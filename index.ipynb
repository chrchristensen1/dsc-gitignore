    "Outside of these narrow use cases, there are resources available for developing `.gitignore` files that are appropriate for your type of project in general. For example, GitHub maintains a [Python `.gitignore` template](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore) (this can be added to your repository by selecting it from the drop-down when you initialize a repository on GitHub). There is also a tool called [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io) that will help you identify useful `.gitignore` lines for your operating system or code editor. It's usually a good idea to use these resources first, before trying to write your own glob syntax!"

    "> In general `git rm` is a useful command that deletes a file from the directory and stages that file deletion with Git (i.e. combines the `rm file_name` and `git add file_name` steps). Adding `--cached` to `git rm` means that Git will no longer track the file, but that the file will not actually be deleted from the directory.\n",

To tell Git to ignore the files, you use a hidden file called `.gitignore` at the root of the repository. This file uses glob syntax to specify which files should be ignored, including `*` to indicate a wildcard and `!` to indicate that a file should _not_ be ignored. We recommend that you use useful defaults rather than writing your own `.gitignore` lines most of the time, and that you always make sure to add private or too-large files to the `.gitignore` as soon as possible so you don't have to rewrite your Git history."
